# This file defines SAMPLE parameters as global variables that will be loaded
# before analysis starts. 
#

# Here is very basic example of the way you can declare in constants the information on samples:

# Declare all the samples names
#SAMPLE_ALL = "All-TregSpl"
#SAMPLE_WT = "WT-TregSpl"
#SAMPLE_KO = "Lta-TregSpl"

# Group the samples in a vector (usefull for llops over the samples)
#SAMPLE_SET = c( SAMPLE_ALL, SAMPLE_WT, SAMPLE_KO)

# Define the colors that will be associated to samples all along the analysis
#SAMPLE_COLOR = c( "#00BA38", "#619CFF", "#F8766D")
#names( SAMPLE_COLOR) = SAMPLE_SET
